# Companies Providing or Refusing Support Letters for PR Applicants in Canada

This repository contains information about companies and their practices regarding the provision of necessary support letters (declaration and authorization forms) for Permanent Residency (PR) applicants in Canada.

## Purpose of This List

- Declaration and authorization forms are often crucial for immigration applications, especially when participating in Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs).
- While companies are not legally obligated to provide forms or letters for immigration purposes, especially for employees already in Canada (e.g., CUAET program workers), some employers may offer this support.
- Open work permit holders often select employers hoping to eventually obtain support for their immigration applications, particularly through PNPs.
- The purpose of this list is purely informational, helping potential employees understand that some employers may refuse to provide support letters, even when doing so carries no cost or obligations.
- There have been instances where employees have worked for a company for an extended period, only to have the employer decline to sign the form. This can result in wasted time and effort (from an immigration perspective), forcing the individual to seek new employment to meet eligibility requirements for PNP or another immigration program.
